    <h2>Day 2 - To Memory and Beyond!</h2>
    <p>
      Now that you have created your first program, today you will learn how to use maths to make your code do something a little more useful.<br>
      Computers are really good at remembering things, so it makes sense to understand how to tell the computer to stoer information (and then
      do somethign with it after).

    <h2>Step 1 - Get to know Statements</h2>
    <p>
      Programming is made up of a set of statements which are executed by your computer’s main brain(which is named CPU, or better to say Core Processing Unit). Each of these statements should follow the programming languages rules in order to make sure your computer actually understands what you want them to do.
      If you’re one of those people who leave the introduction and jump right to the main contents, I would suggest you to go back and take a look at our intro first in order to get some idea how we are going to deal with our computers :P!<br>
      Each line of code you write, is called a statement. (Not all the times though, but mostly). Statements are just like sentences you use in order to interact with people. The difference here is that u are always asking the computer to do something for you. For example, if you type:
      <div class="well">
        System.out.println(3+4);
      </div>
      You are asking your computer to print the result of 3+4 in the output for you.
      From now on, try to remember that anything that you put in the paranthesis in "System.out.println();" prints out the things that you want on the screen.

    <h2>Step 2 - Math gets easy!</h2>
    <p>
      As said before, Java lets you ask your machine a lot of stuff, and of course one of them is to do your math calculations! All the main math operations, meaning addition(+),subtraction(-),multiplication(*) and division(/) are parts of Java language and you can make statements using them and view the results! <br>
      Now, delete everything that you typed in your first project, and type in the statements below in it:
      <div class="well">
        public class Main<br>
        {<br>
          public static void main(String[] args)<br>
          {<br>
            System.out.println(123+54);<br>
            System.out.println(12/5);<br>
            System.out.println(40*5);<br>
            System.out.println(123-54);<br>
          }<br>
        }<br>
      </div>
      Java can also find the remainder of dividing one number by another, which is an operation named mod(%), which is quite a helpful operation in
      You might have noticed that Java rounds the result of 12/5 to number 2, we will discuss the reasons of it later in the next day :P.
      You can do more complicated operations and use paranthesis as well, such as the statement below, try it and see what happens!
      <div class="well">
        System.out.println((123/2)*1+3-(34/60));
      </div>
      now you can get your machine to do some of the math problems! try em out yourself!
