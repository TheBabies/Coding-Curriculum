    <h2>Day 3 - Fun with Input &amp; Data Types...</h2>
      <p>
        Now you know how to get your program to do maths operations, you should learn how to get information off your user.<br>
        That way your program won't be a one trick pony!

    <h2>Scanners</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes you need to get some information from something. Maybe it's a file, or perhaps it's user input. Either way you need
      some code that will read this into your program. Then you can do something with it.<br>
      Enter the Scanner class! A Scanner will take in a <em>stream</em> of data (basically where data is progressively arriving)
      at the program, such as a user typing slowly, and then give the result to your code in a useful format.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, we will be creating a scanner to take user input.
      <pre>
        <code class="language-java">
          Scannner myScanner = new Scanner(System.In);
        </code>
      </pre>
      This creates a new Scanner called myScanner, and creates it using System.In, which is the input on the command line. This will
      make more sense a bit later.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, how does this help us? Now that we have a Scanner we can pull some user input in. Enter the following code, and see what happens
      when you run it.
      <pre>
        <code style="language-java">
          Scanner myScanner = new Scanner(System.In);
          System.out.println("Please enter your name:");
          String name = myScanner.nextLine();
          System.out.println("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!");
        </code>
      </pre>
    </p>
