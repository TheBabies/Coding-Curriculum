    <h2>Day 3 - Fun with Input &amp; Data Types...</h2>
      <p>
        Now you know how to get your program to do maths operations, you should learn how to get information off your user.<br>
        That way your program won't be a one trick pony!

    <h2>Scanners</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes you need to get some information from something. Maybe it's a file, or perhaps it's user input. Either way you need
      some code that will read this into your program. Then you can do something with it.<br>
      Enter the Scanner class! A Scanner will take in a <em>stream</em> of data (basically where data is progressively arriving)
      at the program, such as a user typing slowly, and then give the result to your code in a useful format.
