    <h2>Day 4 - Functions, Functions, Functions...</h2>
      <p>
        You have used several functions so far (like println and nextInt), but now is your chance to write your own!<br>
        Using functions makes your code better because it means you only need to type code once, but you can use it many times througout
        your program. Cool, huh?

    <h2>Functions and beyond!</h2>
    <p>Till now we tried to show basic operations and statement s in java, but there is a way that you can combine couple of statments and build something called a function.
      Functions in programming are pretty much similar to functions in maths. it is basically like a machine which gets something as input, does some changes on it based on the built-in statements in it,
      and gives the result as an output! quite straightforward, isn't it? let's go back to finding the absolute of a number's problem. if you combine all of the statements as below, then you will have a function named
      absolute which can get any integer number and give the absolute of that number back.
      <pre>
        <code class="language-java">
          int absolute(int a)
          {
            if(a>=0)
            {
              return a;
            }
            else
            {
              return a*-1;
            }
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      You can see that the keyword "int" is written before ur function name. That is the type of value your function will give as output, or in coding terminology it <em>returns</em>
      If you return any other value than an integer in the function, you will face an error from your computer! also, after the function name (which here is absolute), you can see a paranthesis which has a declared variable inside.
      this is where you say how many inputs you have, and from what type, and in your function with what name they are called(so that you can do any operation on them). after all these declaration, you will have a block of curly brackets, where you
      actually write the statements of your function. and that is it!
      The point here is that anytime in your code that you need, you can simply send any integer value to this function and get your result back. it is referred to as <em>calling</em> a function. for example, after declaring the absolute function,
      you can use it like this:
      <pre>
        <code class="language-java">
          System.out.println(absolute(3));
          System.out.println(absolute(-5));
          int a = absolute(-7);
          System.out.println(a);
        </code>
      </pre>
      this is the basics of how it works :) try it out in your own IDE and see how it works...

    <h2>Exercises for today</h2>
    <p>Using all the stuff that we have taught you by now, try to do the exercises below!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>write a function that recieves two integers as parameters, and returns the minimum of them.</li>
      <li>implement a function that gets an integer m as parameter, and prints out a string like below<br>
        example: if m = 5, then the function should print this string: 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5
        or if m = 3, the result will be: 3 2 1 0 1 2 3
      </li>
      <li>implement a function that receives two integers as parameters, and prints out their multiplication, without using the multiplier operation!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Go further in action!</h2>
    <p>There are many interesting sequences of numbers in mathematics. Fibonachi sequence is one of them. </p>
