    <h2>Day 4 - Functions, Functions, Functions...</h2>
      <p>
        You have used several functions so far (like println and nextInt), but now is your chance to write your own!<br>
        Using functions makes your code better because it means you only need to type code once, but you can use it many times througout
        your program. Cool, huh?

    <h2>Functions and beyond!</h2>
    <p>Till now we tried to show basic operations and statement s in java, but there is a way that you can combine couple of statments and build something called a function.
      Functions in programming are pretty much similar to functions in maths. it is basically like a machine which gets something as input, does some changes on it based on the built-in statements in it,
      and gives the result as an output! quite straightforward, isn't it? let's go back to finding the absolute of a number's problem. if you combine all of the statements as below, then you will have a function named
      absolute which can get any integer number and give the absolute of that number back.
      <pre>
        <code class="language-java">
          int absolute(int a)
          {
            if(a>=0)
            {
              System.out.println(a);
            }
            else
            {
              System.out.println(a*-1);
            }
          }
        </code>
