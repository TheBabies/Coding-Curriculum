    <h2>Day 4 - Functions, Functions, Functions...</h2>
      <p>
        You have used several functions so far (like println and nextInt), but now is your chance to write your own!<br>
        Using functions makes your code better because it means you only need to type code once, but you can use it many times througout
        your program. Cool, huh?
