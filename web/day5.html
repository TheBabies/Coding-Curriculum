    <h2>Day 5 - An Array of Fun...</h2>
      <p>
        Variables are great, but they have one major flaw: they can only store one value at a time.<br>
        But alas! No more! Today you will learn how to declare and use Lists and Arrays. This will allow
        you to store lots of similar but related data together, making your code even more super-duper.<br>
        We'll also throw some fun loops in too, just for good measure. Today will be a meaty one!

    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    Previously, you saw how you could store things in variables so that they could be used later. Now we're going to
    take this further and show how you can store multiple items in one variable under one name.<br>
    Here's an example of one:<br>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-java">
        // Declare a new Integer array of five items.
        int[] myArray = new int[5];

        // Set each of the five items in the array to some numbers I randomly came up with
        // in my head.

        myArray[0] = 10;
        myArray[1] = 34;
        myArray[2] = 89;
        myArray[3] = 45;
        myArray[4] = 27;
      </code>
    </pre><br>
    <p>
      <em>
        Psst! Notice those double forward slashes? They're called comments. They let you write
        human language in your code to explain to other programmers, your parents, yourself
        the next day, etc. what your code does or why you did it. Comments are super helpful,
        and never be afraid to use them when you do complicated things!
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some things to note about arrays:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every item in the array must be of the same data type (remember day 3?)
        </li>
        <li>
          An array is fixed in size. Notice the 5 in square brackets when we declared the array?<br>
          This sets the size of the array. You cannot make an array bigger without creating a new array
          with a larger size then copying your old data to your new array. Annoying, but it makes
          arrays super efficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arrays are <em>indexed</em>. This means that each item is access by using the name of the array
          (like myArray) followed by the 'index' in square brackets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Array indices start at zero. This means that an array of five items has items 0, 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4.
          Yes it's weird, but welcome to Computing!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well well-sm">
    <h2>For Loops</h2>
    <p>
      Let's discuss something completely different! I know your explanation of arrays got cut a bit short there,
      but it's with good reason...I promise!
    </p>
    <p>
      Loops are awesome things. They let you tell the computer to do something more than once
      without typing the code over and over. Better yet, you can let the computer figure out
      with other code how many times something should happen, then it will do it. Here's an example...
      <pre>
        <code class="language-java">
          for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
          {
            System.out.println("Hello computer! i is " + i);
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      It looks really complicated but just needs breaking down.<br>
      Firstly, every for loop has three important parts in brackets, each separated by
      semicolons:
      <ol>
        <li>
          The first part is the declaration of a counter variable. This is where
          you tell Java what the counter will be. Without a counter Java will not
          know how many times the loop will run.<br>
          In this example, int i = 0 means "let's count with an integer number. The
          first value will be zero."
        </li>
        <li>
          The second section is the condition for carrying on.<br>
          In this example, we used i < 10. This means "keep doing this code over
          and over and over again so long as i is less than 10. As soon as i hits
          10 Java will stop running the code within the curly braces after the for loop.
        </li>
        <li>
          The third section is the code that will be run every time the loop cycles.<br>
          In this example we are using i++. This is shorthand for "increase i by 1".
        </li>
      </ol>
      The result of this is that the code will create an empty variable called i,
      setting it to zero. Then every time the code runs i will be increased by 1 until
      it is 10, at which point it'll stop.<br>
      Run the code in IntelliJ IDEA and see what your output is.

    <h2>Putting It All Together.....</h2>
    <p>
      So now you have two very useful tools: arrays and loops. Wouldn't it be great if they
      went together somehow? Now is the time for that!
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider this example:<br>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-java">
          // Create a new Scanner object to get input from the user.
          Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

          // Create a new double array to store the five numbers the user will enter.
          double[] numbers = new double[5];

          // Print out the request to the user.
          System.out.println("Please enter five numbers, pressing enter after each one:")

          // Get five numbers from the user and store them in the numbers array.
          for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
          {
            numbers[i] = s.nextDouble();
          }

          // Create a new double to store the average in.
          double average;

          // Add all the numbers to the average
          for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
          {
            average = average + numbers[i];
          }

          // Divide the average variable by 5 to get the average of the five numbers
          // entered.
          average = average / 5;

          // Write the average on the screen.
          System.out.println("The average of those five numbers are: " + average);
        </code>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a read through the example, run it and see what happens. Do you understand why it works?
      Now think of a more efficient way to implement it. Do you really need the array at all in this example?
