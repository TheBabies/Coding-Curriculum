    <h2>Day 6 - Classes, Objects and lots of awesome new words...</h2>
      <p>
        You now know how to store data and group lots of commands together into functions, but as useful as this is,
        it's still very difficult to group your variables and functions together. But, you guessed it, today we will learn
        how to get round this problem. You will start to see computer programs and the real world align in a way that
        makes Java incredibly powerful. Prepare for awesomeness....

    <h2>Classes?!?</h2>
    <p>Previously, we have taught you how to use types in java such as int, char or double. these types are also known as <em>primitive</em> types.
      but what if you want to make your own type and try to get copies of that type just like the primitive ones we had? Here we are going to introduce
      a new concept named <em>Classes</em> a class is a blueprint, a pattern that you give in order to build new types, which from now on we call as
      <em>objects</em>. Till now you have been coding in a file named Main.java, and if you look at your codes all of them are inside a curly bracket which
      has the expression "public class Main" on top. Java is an object oriented language meaning every single function(or method for classes) shoud be inside a class, and you
      can make new classes and work with them! This might sound a little bit confusing so let's take a look at the piece of code below:
      <br>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-java">
          public class Dog
          {
            public String name;
            public String breed;
            public int age;

            public void bark()
            {
              System.out.println("Doge is barking!");
            }
            public void play()
            {
              System.out.println("Doge is playing!");
            }
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <br>
      This is the class "Dog". Remember that each class should be in a file named same as your classes name, and the class name should start with a capital letter, unlike
      the name of variables and funcitons(we will call functions "methods" from now cause you are learning about the object oriented programming and methods are the functions
      that are related to a class.)<br>As said before, classes are like new types, but the difference between them and primitive types are that they can hold different <em>attribures</em>.
      for example, a dog in the real world has a name, a breed and also an age. a dog barks and plays. these are the features of a dog, and should be included in the dog's class.
      but how are we going to use these stuff? We'll see in the next part!

    <h2>Objects</h2>
      <p>
        We talked about how we make classes to build up new objects from them. For example if we hae a class "Dog", that means we have a Dog concept in the programme, and we can make actual dogs
        from that concept, meaning making dog <em>objects</em>.for example assume that we have
