    <h2>Day 6 - Classes, Objects and lots of awesome new words...</h2>
      <p>
        You now know how to store data and group lots of commands together into functions, but as useful as this is,
        it's still very difficult to group your variables and functions together. But, you guessed it, today we will learn
        how to get round this problem. You will start to see computer programs and the real world align in a way that
        makes Java incredibly powerful. Prepare for awesomeness....

    <h2>Classes?!?</h2>
    <p>Previously, we have taught you how to use types in java such as int, char or double. these types are also known as <em>primitive</em> types.
      but what if you want to make your own type and try to get copies of that type just like the primitive ones we had? Here we are going to introduce
      a new concept named <em>Classes</em> a class is a blueprint, a pattern that you give in order to build new types, which from now on we call as
      <em>objects</em>. Till now you have been coding in a file named Main.java, and if you look at your codes all of them are inside a curly bracket which
      has the expression "public class Main" on top. Java is an object oriented language meaning every single function(or method for classes) shoud be inside a class, and you
      can make new classes and work with them! This might sound a little bit confusing so let's take a look at the piece of code below:
      <br>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-java">
          public class Dog
          {
            public String name;
            public String breed;
            public int age;

            public void bark()
            {
              System.out.println("Doge is barking!");
            }
            public void play()
            {
              System.out.println("Doge is playing!");
            }
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <br>
      This is the class "Dog". Remember that each class should be in a file named same as your classes name, and the class name should start with a capital letter, unlike
      the name of variables and funcitons(we will call functions "methods" from now cause you are learning about the object oriented programming and methods are the functions
      that are related to a class.)<br>As said before, classes are like new types, but the difference between them and primitive types are that they can hold different <em>attribures</em>.
      for example, a dog in the real world has a name, a breed and also an age. a dog barks and plays. these are the features of a dog, and should be included in the dog's class.
      but how are we going to use these stuff? We'll see in the next part!
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="well well-sm">
    <h2>Objects</h2>
      <p>
        We talked about how we make classes to build up new objects from them. For example if we hae a class "Dog", that means we have a Dog concept in the programme, and we can make actual dogs
        from that concept, meaning making dog <em>objects</em>. in order to make a new dog object and work with it, you can do it in your Main class, in main method. here is the time to explain what
        main method does. <br> the method main is a function inside your Main class and is where your programme starts running. each programme must have one and only one main method as it should know
        where to start executing your statements! <br> look at the code below:
        <pre>
          <code class="language-java">
            public class Main
            {
              public static void main(String[] args)
              {
                Dog dog1 = new Dog();

                dog1.name = "Chico";
                dog1.breed = "German Shepherd";
                dog1.age = 12;

                dog1.bark();
                dog1.play();
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <br> in the code above, we build up an object named dog1, in the first line of the main class. we give the name "Chico" to the new dog, breed "German Shepherd" and age. If you run the code
        you can see that it shows the barking and playing messages in the console!<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep in mind that you have to put the Dog class in a Seperate file. In Intellij, simply right click on the src folder in the side bar and make a new java class named Dog.</li>
        </ul>
        you can make multiple objects from one class as well. like this:
        <pre>
          <code class="language-java">
            public static void main(String[] args)
            {
              Dog dog2 = new Dog();
              Dog dog3 = new Dog();

              dog2.name = "Brownie";
              dog3.name = "Diamond";
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <br>There are still so many things you need to learn about so stay with us!... :P
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="well well-sm">
    <h2>public? private?! What is happening!</h2>
    <p>
      You probably have noticed the keyword "public" before many of the given attributes of the Dog class and the class name itself. This concept shows the <em>level of access</em> in other classes.
      For example, you have seen that we could change the name of the dog1 object in the class Main. meaning that we have access to that attribute in the Main class. however, if before the attribute
      instead of "public" keyword we use "private", we could only work with it and change it inside the class Dog and we could not change anything in any other class such as main. The usage of this is
      to make sure not everyone can change your code in some cases that you want to be the only person accessing that class, and also in a concept named inheritence which you can learn about through
      searching the links in our exercises!
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="well well-sm">
    <h2>Constructor Constructs!</h2>
    <p>
      if you look at the part of code that we made a new object of the dog, it might look a little bit odd to you. the point here is that when you are making a new object, you make 2 new things in the
      memory. one is called the <em>reference variable</em>. this is the name you choose for your object, "Dog dog1",which means dog1 is a variable of type Dog. the second part is the actual object that
      you build with the part "new Dog();" this part makes an actual object in your memory, and your reference variable meaning "dog1" points to it's address in the memory. so a reference variable of type Dog
      points to an object of type Dog in the memory.<br> If you look a little bit further, you can see the part "Dog()" looks like a method. You're right, it actually is a method. it's a method that builds up
      a new object of type Dog. this object is called the <em>constructor</em>.<br>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-java">
          public class Dog
          {
            public String name;
            public String breed;
            public int age;

            public Dog(String name, String breed, int age)
            {
                this.name = name;
                this.breed = breed;
                this.age = age;
            }
          }

          public
        </code>
      </pre>
      <br>
      The constructor builds the object dog for you, and sets the initial values of name, breed and age based on what you give to it as the parameters of the constructor method!<br>
      Every single class has a constructor. even if you don't make any constructor for it, java itself makes an empty method with no parameters and when making new objects of that class, calls that method. You can
      also have multiple constructors. but remember, if you made a constructor that has a parameter, such as above, you cannot call a constructor with no parameter unless you make one in your class. as java sees that you
      have made a constructor in your code and won't bother making a new one for you! So keep that in mind! :P <br> Note that the keyword "this" is just to show you are pointing to the variable of your object, the method
      that you are working with, meaning this.name is the name of your object, while name is just the variable which is given as the parameter of the constructor and does not exist in your object! <br>

    <h2>Exercises for Today</h2>
    <h4>Warm up!</h4>
    <p>
      Classes and the whole object oriented concept is a little bit hard to get in the first place, therefore you have to do some research on the concepts that you have found a little vague by now (
      and by reasearch I basically mean google! google is the best friend of every single programmer!) So that you will get more familiar and used to the OOP concepts!<br> Try to do the exercises below as well!
      <ol>
        <li>Make a class named Fruit. the fruit class should have attributes such as colour and taste. be creative! add your own attributes to it as well!</li>
        <li>Create new fruits. choose the reference variables name as your fruit's name so it would make sense.</li>
        <li>try to add 3 different constructors in your Fruit class and call them when making new objects.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>Go further in action!</h4>
    <p>
      If you have done all well by now, here are some resources you can go and learn about harder concepts in the object oriented programming.
      <ul>
        <li>Inheritence is a really important concept in object oriented programming.<a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_inheritance.htm">this link</a>should help you out with it.</li>
        <li>Encapsulation is a concept related to Inheritence. find it <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_encapsulation.htm">here</a> and learn about it!</li>
      </ul>
      There are more stuff on the internet that you can learn from them. don't hesitate! go for it!
