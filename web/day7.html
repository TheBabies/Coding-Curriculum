    <h2>Day 7 - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Conclusion...</h2>
      <p>
        You made it to the final day! Congratulations on becoming a programmer!<br>
        Today we will be putting everything you have learnt together into a Rock, Paper, Scissors game
        that you can play with your friends.
      </p>

    <h4>Let's Begin...</h4>
    <p>
      Firstly, this part of the course assumes you know how to play Rock-Paper-Scissors.
      If not, take a look on Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors">here</a>
      because otherwise you'll be hopelessly confused for the rest of today!
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming you have a better idea of how Rock-Paper-Scissors works, the plan is to build this game using
      a mixture of all the skills you have learnt over the last week. This will need all the following skills:
      <ul>
        <li>
            Writing things on the screen
        </li>
        <li>
          User input with Scanners
        </li>
        <li>
          Functions
        </li>
        <li>
          If (and else) statements
        </li>
        <li>
          For loops
        </li>
        <li>
          Random Numbers
        </li>
        <li>
          do...while loops
        </li>
        <li>
          switch...case statements
        </li>
      </ul>
      Lots of stuff there! But don't worry if you have forgotten anything, because we'll walk you right through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, before we do anything you need to create a new project in IntelliJ like on the first day. Make sure you
      click the option to <em>Use a template</em>, and tick <em>Command Line App</em>. You'll be presented with an empty
      code window.
    </p>

    <h4>What's on the Menu?</h4>
    <p>
      This is probably your first Java project, and therefore you'll be undoubtedly nervous about diving head-first into this one.
      Therefore, each section will tell you exactly what you need to achieve. If you get stuck, the answer will be hidden
      in a spoiler. The complete solution is also at the bottom of this page in case you want to see how it all fits together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first function we will build is the code that outputs a menu asking the player whether they would like to play with
      a friend or against the computer. It should do the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Show the game title</li>
        <li>A request for the user to choose an option</li>
        <li>Option to play alone against the computer</li>
        <li>Option to play against a friend</li>
        <li>Option to exit the game</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Aim for something that looks a bit like this:<br>
