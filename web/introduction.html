    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
      Great to see you here! Stick around with us and we'll get you programming in just one week.<br>
      It's best if you do one lesson a day. Each should take you about an hour, so do your homework and then do an hour of programming.
      Each day will add to the last, so by the end of the week you will be a Java programmer.

    <h3>What is Programming?</h3>
    <img src="img/intro/happyhackers.jpg" class="img-responsive"><br>
    <em>Programmers looking happy because code is cool.</em>
    <p>
      Computer programming is all around us. Right now you are using <em>many</em> programs, all made by people like you.
      The idea is that you tell the computer what to do using coded instructions. From this you can start with the most basic
      of software and over time you can build up to more complicated, larger projects. If you are going to talk to another
      person you need to know a language that they know. Computers work in the same way, except they cannot speak English. Your
      job as a programmer is to learn a language that a computer can understand, and that's what this website will teach you.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you write code in a language like Java it is translated into patterns of 1s and 0s that the computer can understand.
      Each group of 1s and 0s is called an 'instruction' that your computer's Processor chip can follow. Obviously 1s and 0s are far
      too complicated for even the best programmers to work with, so a programming language is used that's close enough to English to
      read and write, but organised enough for a computer to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's really important to remember that without programmers there would be no programs, and without programs your
      computer would pretty much be useless! The world does not have enough programmers so we need more people like you
      to learn this stuff.

    <h3>What will I be learning?</h3>
    <p>
      In this tutorial you will be learning a programming language called Java. Java is important because it works on all computers
      (Windows, Mac and Linux), and is needed if you ever want to build apps for Android phones. Almost every software company
      uses Java sometimes. Also, it's a really nice language for beginners (like you!) to start with because a lot of the
      difficult memory things are done for you, so you can focus on telling the computer what to do and not how to do it.

    <h3>Why should I bother?</h3>
    <p>
      If you are interested in how the technology in your life works or you want technology to do something new you must learn to program.
      Also if you get good at it there are a lot of very well paid programming jobs that you can get. Programming is a really enjoyable
      life skill that will help you to think more intelligently whilst stretching your brain.

    <h3>What will I need?</h3>
    <p>
      Learning to program does not need much at all! Just grab a computer running Windows or Mac (or Linux, if you're really adventurous...)
      and follow our easy tutorial to install IntelliJ IDEA. This will help you write code quickly.<br>
      Other than that, students claim to be at least 16502% better at programming when they have a brain...
