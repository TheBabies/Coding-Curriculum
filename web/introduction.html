    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    Great to see you here! Stick around with us and we'll get you programming in just one week.<br>
    It's best if you do one lesson a day. Each should take you about an hour, so do your homework and then do an hour of programming.
    Each day will add to the last, so by the end of the week you will be a Java programmer.
