    <h3>Our Objectives and Aims</h3>
    <p>
      Our objective with 'Ye Olde Cuppe of Java' is to introduce students to the Java programming language.
      The project was designed to be an insight into the language as well as programming in general by coding for just one
      hour a day for a week.  After six days, the student will then have the skills required to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors
      game, giving them something to work towards. This shows the student what can be done and will hopefully inspire them to
      continue learning Java or to look at other programming languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project was created to fit into a one hour session everyday for a week so that students are able to fit programming into
      their invariably busy schedules. We hope that this will encourage more students to take part, as some may think that learning
      to program will be too time consuming. Breaking it up into small chunks makes learning more manageable and enjoyable. In each
      hour session, the student learns a small amount of Java theory before being presented with exercises to test their knowledge.
      There are also sources available in each section providing the student with access to more information if they wish to learn more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our project will hopefully open more students up to programming and give them one of the most important skills of the 21st century.
      Programming is no longer just a skill for students who wish to study Computer Science beyond school; it is a life skill that is
      becoming fundamental to every subject in school. Physics students can use programming to model and speed up their equations, while
      English students will appreciate the practice with adhering to linguistic rules. Programming is inherently logical and structured,
      with results of experimentation immediately visible to anybody who wants to learn it. There is no waiting for a teacher to mark work -
      just compile and run to see what you have learned!
